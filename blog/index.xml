      <description>A new release of BDK is finally out! The v0.2.0 release contains many exciting new features, bug fixes and overall improvements. This release also marks the beginning of our new regular release schedule, which will see us pushing out a new release every four weeks. We think this is a good compromise to ensure that developers using BDK have access to all the new features and fixes as soon as possible, at least while the library is still evolving very fast as it is right now.</description>

All the information written in this article are valid for the current master git branch, and should remain valid for the upcoming v0.</description>

      <description>I have tried to setup a 2 of 2 multi signature infrastructure with two different wallets, which know nothing about each other, but are compliant with two very important protocols: Output Descriptors and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions described in BIP 174.
Before these two protocols came into existence, making a multi signature setup and spending from it was possible only if the involved parties were using the same wallet (eg. Electrum Desktop Wallet).</description>
